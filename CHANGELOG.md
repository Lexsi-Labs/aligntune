## [0.1.10] — 2026-08-05

Initial public release.

### Added
- **Distillation framework**: Standard, GOLD (cross-tokenizer), SDFT, and SDPO (self-distillation) methods under a unified config.
- **ES backend rollout abstraction**: a standard `transformers`-based rollout backend and a vLLM-backed one for hyperscale generation.
- **GBMPO**: four divergence-specific implementations consolidated into a single configurable trainer (`divergence_type` field).
